# Unemployment Rate Analysis â€“ India (COVID-19 Impact)
This data science project explores the rise in unemployment across Indian states during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially between May and July 2020. The analysis uses real-world data to understand the effect of nationwide lockdowns on employment trends in both rural and urban regions.

## Objective
To analyze how the unemployment rate changed across various Indian states during the COVID-19 lockdown period and identify the regions that were most affected.

##  Steps Performed
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Used the dataset: `Unemployment in India.csv`
   - Includes region-wise monthly unemployment statistics.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values.
   - Stripped column names to fix formatting issues.
   - Converted the date column to proper `datetime` format.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized unemployment trends across different regions.
   - Plotted time series and heatmaps to show trends.
   - Identified the peak unemployment period (Mayâ€“July 2020).

4. **Interpretation**  
   - Explained the causes of high unemployment: lockdowns, migration, job loss in the informal sector.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm IDE

## ðŸ“ˆ Outcome
- Found that unemployment peaked at ~75% in several states (e.g., Maharashtra, Punjab, Kerala, Karnataka) during Mayâ€“July 2020.
- Explained that this spike was due to:
  - Nationwide lockdown
  - Mass job losses in informal sectors
  - Reverse migration of workers
- Demonstrated the power of data science in understanding real-world economic impact.
